OK... AGORA JÁ TEMOS TODOS OS 5 CARDS, 1 EM CIMA DO OUTRO...





--> ISSO NO LAYOUT MOBILE, QUE ESTÁ PRATICAMENTE PRONTO....









--> MAS NO DESKTOP, QUEREMOS CRIAR 1 LAYOUT ALTERNATIVO,


COM DIFERENTES TAMANHOS PARA CADA CELL...








--> ESSE TIPO DE LAYOUT É APENAS POSSÍVEL COM GRID....





-> O FLEXBOX NÃO CONSEGUE FAZER ISSO, PQ 
    ELE É 'ONE-DIMENSIONAL'...






--> A DIFERENÇA, PARA O GRID, É QUE 
    O GRID É 'TWO-DIMENSIONAL'... (podemos span 1 ou múltiplas COLUMNS, ROWS, WHATEVER)...




--> SE QUISÉSSEMOS FAZER ISSO COM FLEXBOX, SERÍAMOS FORÇADOS A USAR MÚLTIPLOS 
    CONTAINERS... MAS, COM GRID, PODEMOS USAR APENAS 1 ÚNICO CONTAINER...














--> DEIXAMOS O CONTAINER (grid container) Como 'grid',




que vai ativar o grid,
 
mas não vai fazer nada... temos que especificar as columns manualmente...











--> ADICIONAMOS UM GAP DE 6,

TIPO ASSIM:




      <div class="grid gap-6 text-white">










-> QUEREMOS QUE A NOSSA GRID SEJA DE 'grid-cols-1'


em telas menores,

por isso escrevemos:



      <div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 text-white">















MAS QUANDO CHEGARMOS NAS MEDIUM SCREENS E UPWARDS,


QUEREMOS QUE 


AS COLUMNS SEJAM DEFINIDAS COMO 4...








eX:





      <div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 text-white">













E ISSO VAI COLOCAR NOSSOS ITEMS EM 4 COLUMNS, SIM...










-> MAS APENAS ISSO NÃO BASTA...








-> QUEREMOS DEFINIR TAMBÉM NOSSOS ROWS COMO SENDO 2...




Ex:




      <div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 md:grid-rows-2 text-white">









--> isso vai colocar os nossos items overflowing em 1 segunda linha, logo abaixo...













--> E QUEREMOS ESPECIFICAR DIFERENTES 'SPANS'

PARA CADA COL...





QUEREMOS QUE A PRIMEIRA BOX FAÇA 'SPAN' DE 2 columns, EM TELAS MEDIUM OR HIGHER...



por isso escrevemos assim:







        <div class="relative md:col-span-2 p-10 rounded-xl bg-purple-700">















JÁ A BOX 2 SERÁ MANTIDA DA MANEIRA QUE ESTÁ...









A BOX 3 SERÁ 'KIRA',

NOS DESKTOPS... QUEREMOS QUE KIRA FAÇA 'SPAN' DE 2 ROWS, MAS QUE OCUPE APENAS 1 ÚNICA COL...



-> É POR ISSO QUE ESCREVEMOS ASSIM:




        <!-- Box 3 (will be shown only on medium and larger screens) -->
        <div class="hidden p-10 rounded-xl md:block md:row-span-2 text-gray-900 bg-white">
















OK... AGORA QUEREMOS QUE A BOX DO PATRICK ABRAMS TAMBÉM OCUPE 2 COLS... (mas n 2 rows)...






É POR ISSO QUE ESCREVEMOS ASSIM:
